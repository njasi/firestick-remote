# firestick-remote
A quick Firestick remote interface.

My remote broke and instead of buying a replacement I did this.

Currently I've only added minimum functionality to it (dpad, select, power, volume), but may add more in the future if I find I need more buttons.

The app runs on a Flask server so it can be started from a computer/mediacenter and then used on a phone.
